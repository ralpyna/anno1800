‚ùó This repository is not intended for release or distribution, but only for code review and modification.

* Anno 1800 is a strategy game, which requires a lot of time. But most of that time is unnecessary and repetitive. Especially in the latter half of the game, these disadvantages are highlighted when purchasing products such as equipment, talent and others from a shop.
* This repository was created to develop automatic macros for purchasing products in the game.
* I will use this code personally when this project is completed, and if anyone needs this code, please feel free to use it.
